# Personal Website

A simple personal portfolio built with **HTML + CSS + JavaScript**.

## Structure
- `index.html` — Resume-like homepage (about, education, skills, projects, contact)
- `visualizations.html` — Two SVG-based visualizations (one chart + one creative art)
- `style.css` — Responsive styling (light/dark theme)
- `main.js` — Interactions (theme toggle, form validation)
- `vis.js` — SVG generation via JS (no external libs)
- `README.md` — You are here

## How to run
Open `index.html` locally or deploy via GitHub Pages (recommended).  
If this repo is named `yourusername.github.io`, it will auto-serve at `https://yourusername.github.io/`.

## Validation
- Ensure semantic HTML and pass validators (per course instructions).
