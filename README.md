#Assignment 2 - Carolyn Fan 301390374




##Purpose

This website is a personal portfolio created as my Assignment 2 for IAT 355.
The purpose of the site is to showcase my background, skills, and projects, while also practicing front-end web development and version control with GitHub Pages, and that is also my first time try to use java create visualization of data.





##The site serves as:

A professional online presence

A portfolio of my academic projects

A demonstration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development skills





##Technologies Used

HTML5 — Structure of the pages

CSS3 — Styling, responsive design, and theme support (dark / light mode)

JavaScript (ES6) — Interactivity, form validation, theme toggling

SVG with JavaScript — Data visualization and generative art

Git & GitHub — Version control and deployment using GitHub Pages




##Site Navigation

index.html — Home
Contains a personal introduction (name, program, and interests), education background, skills, project experience, and contact information.

visualizations.html — Visualization Page
Displays two SVG-based graphics generated with JavaScript:

A data visualization chart (procrastination reasons ranking).

A piece of creative SVG art (study posture bar chart).

###Contact Section — Demo Form
Included on the homepage, this form demonstrates front-end validation (such as email format and message length). It does not actually send emails and is provided for demonstration purposes only.
